
1. Install OBS via exe or from OBS website (https://obsproject.com/download)

2. Make scenes named "LIVE" "LOW" and "BRB" also make PRIVACY, STARTING and ENDING if you want (no commas, keep all capital)

3. make a "belabox" Media source under LIVE/LOW use your OBS source URL from https://cloud.belabox.net under SRT(LA) relays tab
   EXAMPLE OF SETTINGS https://prnt.sc/EDynNg_VY5Tk
    -Network buffering: 1MB
    -Input: OBS source URL from https://cloud.belabox.net under SRT(LA) relays tab
    -Input format: mpegts
    -Reconnect delay: 2S
    -UNCHECK user hardware decoding
    -CHECK show nothing when playback ends
    -CHECK close file when inactive
    -Keep the rest as default

4. Edit them how you see fit (keep LIVE and LOW the same, just add a "low bitrate" text so viewers know its laggy

5. install plugins from OBS plug ins folder if you want (multi stream and blur filter)(just double click file and it installs to OBS)

6. add another Belabox source under PRIVACY(use same settings as step 3), go to filters and add a 55+% blur on it. add text saying its on a privacy scene
